## Introduction
**The C Programming Language** is a very popular book and sometimes people refer to it as **K&R**. The authors *Brian W. Kernighan* and *Dennis M. Ritchie* did a very good job of explaining the core concepts of programming. The focus of the book is the C programming language, however, the approach is general, so it can be extrapolated to other programming languages.

### Compilers
To be able to write programs in C, a compiler is required. There are many options available for each operating system.

#### macOS
The [**Clang**](https://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html) compiler is a very nice choice when using macOS. It is available with **Xcode Command Line Tools**, which can be easily installed using the following command:

```shell
xcode-select --install
```
