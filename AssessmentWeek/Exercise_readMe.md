1. Machine code is a strictly numerical language which is designed to run as fast as possible, and may be considered as the lowest-level representation of a compiled or assembled computer program or as a primitive and hardware-dependent programming language.
2. A compiler is a special program that translates a programming language's source code into machine code, bytecode or another programming language. The source code is typically written in a high-level, human-readable language such as Java or C++.
3. An argument is a statement or group of statements called premises intended to determine the degree of truth or acceptability of another statement called conclusion. Arguments can be studied from three main perspectives: the logical, the dialectical and the rhetorical perspective.
4. An algorithm is a procedure used for solving a problem or performing a computation. Algorithms act as an exact list of instructions that conduct specified actions step by step in either hardware- or software-based routines. Algorithms are widely used throughout all areas of IT.

Data types
If data structures are the building blocks of algorithms and computer programs, the primitive -- or base -- data types are the building blocks of data structures. The typical base data types include the following:

Boolean, which stores logical values that are either true or false.
integer, which stores a range on mathematical integers -- or counting numbers. Different sized integers hold a different range of values -- e.g., a signed 8-bit integer holds values from -128 to 127, and an unsigned long 32-bit integer holds values from 0 to 4,294,967,295.
Floating-point numbers, which store a formulaic representation of real numbers.
Fixed-point numbers, which are used in some programming languages and hold real values but are managed as digits to the left and the right of the decimal point.
Character, which uses symbols from a defined mapping of integer values to symbols.
Pointers, which are reference values that point to other values.
String, which is an array of characters followed by a stop code -- usually a "0" value -- or is managed using a length field that is an integer value.

Types of data structures
The data structure type used in a particular situation is determined by the type of operations that will be required or the kinds of algorithms that will be applied. The various data structure types include the following:

Array. An array stores a collection of items at adjoining memory locations. Items that are the same type are stored together so the position of each element can be calculated or retrieved easily by an index. Arrays can be fixed or flexible in length
Stack. A stack stores a collection of items in the linear order that operations are applied. This order could be last in, first out (LIFO) or first in, first out (FIFO).
Queue. A queue stores a collection of items like a stack; however, the operation order can only be first in, first out.
Linked list. A linked list stores a collection of items in a linear order. Each element, or node, in a linked list contains a data item, as well as a reference, or link, to the next item in the list.
Tree. A tree stores a collection of items in an abstract, hierarchical way. Each node is associated with a key value, with parent nodes linked to child nodes -- or subnodes. There is one root node that is the ancestor of all the nodes in the tree.

Heap. A heap is a tree-based structure in which each parent node's associated key value is greater than or equal to the key values of any of its children's key values.
Graph. A graph stores a collection of items in a nonlinear fashion. Graphs are made up of a finite set of nodes, also known as vertices, and lines that connect them, also known as edges. These are useful for representing real-world systems such as computer networks.
Trie. A trie, also known as a keyword tree, is a data structure that stores strings as data items that can be organized in a visual graph.
Hash table. A hash table -- also known as a hash map -- stores a collection of items in an associative array that plots keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to convert an index into an array of buckets that contain the desired data item.
